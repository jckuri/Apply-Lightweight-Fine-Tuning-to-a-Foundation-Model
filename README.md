# Apply Lightweight Fine-Tuning to a Foundation Model

In my first submission, I used the Jupyter notebook [LightweightFineTuning.ipynb](LightweightFineTuning.ipynb).<br/>
My first reviewer told me to avoid training the pretrained model.<br/>
And I failed just 1 rubric item.

In my second submission, I used the Jupyter notebook [LightweightFineTuning2.ipynb](LightweightFineTuning2.ipynb).<br/>
In this Jupyter notebook, I'm not training the pretrained model.<br/>
As a result, the accuracies are bad, close to 50%, which is random guessing for 2 variables.<br/>
I corrected what my first reviewer asked me to do.<br/>
I hope this time I will pass the project.<br/>
Thanks.
